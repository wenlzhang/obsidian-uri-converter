## Why You Need URI Converter

**URI Converter** was developed to address a specific challenge faced by Obsidian users, including myself. It embodies two essential [PTKM Core Principles](https://ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles) that shape its functionality:

- **Providing Context**: Ensuring no valuable information is lost in the task management process
- **Linking Everything**: Bridging the gap between Obsidian and Todoist

### The Challenge

As an avid Obsidian user, I frequently copy links to notes, headings, or blocks and use them in external apps like Todoist. These links provide valuable context for tasks in Todoist, but they didn't function as bidirectional links within Obsidian when copied back. This disrupted the seamless navigation and connection that Obsidian is known for.

### The Solution

**URI Converter** was created to automate the conversion of external links into Obsidian-compatible internal links. With the URI Converter, you can:

1. **Automate Link Conversion**: Save time by automatically converting external links to internal Obsidian links
2. **Maintain Bidirectional Links**: Preserve the powerful linking capabilities of Obsidian
3. **Enhance Workflow Efficiency**: Integrate seamlessly with external apps like Todoist
4. **Focus on Productivity**: Spend less time on manual tasks and more on what matters
